# Checklist: A checklist for scientific papers

If you were starting a study from scratch, what would be the ideal way to structure the planning, analyses, and publication? In a perfect world, how would you conduct science?

This checklist was created to help encourage best practices in experiment design, statistical analyses, and scientific publishing. Although it may not always be feasible to follow all of these guidelines, doing some is better than doing nothing. :)

The first page is designed to be a succinct checklist, but that a few thoughts (and more importantly, sources to read) are listed on the following pages to help encourage thinking and discussion about the issue.

The checklist will no doubt evolve over time and is tailored to our lab's specific needs. You are welcome to use the checklist as-is, or to adapt it in whatever way might be useful for your own publishing.

It's worth noting that some (many?) of these guidelines are controversial. My view is that it's better to have a discussion about these important issues, regardless of what you, as authors, decide is right for a particular publication. Better for PIs because we should be aware of the pros and cons of publishing issues, and better for trainees because they can be exposed to these.
